# Graphing

This is a simple graphing calculator I made with PyCairo. I plan on making upgrades later. For now, it graphs functions of the form y=f(x) .

To graph, use function `plot_func(cairo_context, lambda_function, ORIGIN, X_axis_unit, Y_axis_unit, x_lower_limit, x_upper_limit)`

Very barebones at the moment.
